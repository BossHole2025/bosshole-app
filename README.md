# BossHole

A brutally honest motivational PWA for the self-employed. Built with React, Tailwind, and sarcasm.

## ðŸ”§ How to Deploy

1. **Build your app** (if using Create React App):
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Copy all files from this package into your `/public` folder.**

3. **Deploy to a static host (Netlify, Vercel, Firebase).**

4. **Make sure icons are placed in `/public`** and linked in `manifest.json`.

5. **Try it on your phone** â€“ install as a Progressive Web App and allow notifications.

Enjoy the tough love!
